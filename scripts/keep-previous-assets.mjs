/**
 * keep-previous-assets.mjs — every export also carries the /_next/static files of recent earlier
 * builds. Runs in postbuild, after `next build` and the live-kit gate (check-live-out.mjs).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Google fetches a page's HTML first and renders it later, from a queue, with whatever JS and CSS
 * that HTML names. A Pages deploy is a full replacement, so a deploy in between deletes hashed
 * chunks the HTML still points to — measured here 2026-10-19: the 2026-10-12 build's
 * /_next/static/chunks/225r2ny9zhm8a.js answers 404 since the 2026-10-13 deploy. On the sister site
 * gagoline.co.il (same stack, same deploy script) rendering such HTML with a chunk gone gave Next's
 * default "Application error" page — no title, meta or canonical — 6 of 6 times locally, the leading
 * explanation for Google filing that homepage under an unrelated site's canonical. This site deploys
 * every few days and Google crawls it slowly, so the window is real. Ported from gagoline.co.il's
 * scripts/keep-previous-assets.mjs (2026-10-18) unchanged in logic.
 *
 * HOW
 *
 * .static-archive/ (gitignored) holds every /_next/static file of recent builds. .builds.json there
 * records each build's OWN files, keyed by a hash of its index.html. An archived file's mtime is the
 * last moment a build owning it was the newest export — not when it was built — so a build that
 * stayed live for months is protected for KEEP_DAYS after it was replaced:
 *   - this build's own files            → now (it is the newest export)
 *   - out.prev/'s own files             → now (ops/deploy-site.ps1 rotates the live export there
 *                                          before building, so it was live until this moment; an
 *                                          out.prev with no record is treated as all-own)
 *   - anything older than KEEP_DAYS     → pruned
 * then every remaining archived file this export lacks is copied in. Hashed names never collide, so
 * old and new sit side by side and Pages dedupes the upload. 60 days matches Vercel's skew window
 * for Googlebot and Bingbot. Re-running on the same export changes nothing. No page references a
 * carried file, so it costs deploy weight only — docs/performance-guidelines.md §1 counts it on its
 * own row. A LIVE_DRAFT export (.live-draft, written by check-live-out.mjs) is never archived.
 * Rollback via `wrangler pages deploy .\out.prev` does NOT carry the newest build's chunks — see
 * CLAUDE.md §10.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/keep-previous-assets.mjs   (always works on the repo root)
