# Stop hook -- format files changed in the git working tree with Prettier.
#
# Runs at turn end (Stop), AFTER all edits, so it never races the Edit tool's
# file-state tracking (a per-edit formatter would rewrite the file mid-session
# and cause "file has been modified" errors on the next edit).
#
# NOTE: this repo has no `prettier` devDependency yet, and --no-install means the
# hook never downloads one. Until `npm i -D prettier` is run it is a silent no-op;
# the moment Prettier is installed it starts formatting with zero config changes.
#
# Best-effort and async: failures are swallowed, exit is always 0, and nothing
# is written to stdout (so it can never corrupt another Stop hook's output).
# ASCII-only on purpose (PS 5.1 mis-decodes non-ASCII bytes in -File scripts).
